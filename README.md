# AI/ML Journey – Beginner Projects & Ideas

Welcome! I'm currently learning computer science through [CS50 by Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) and building a strong foundation in math for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This repository is where I’ll document:
- 📚 My learning progress
- 🤖 Simple AI/ML experiments
- 💡 Creative ideas in AI/ML
- 🧪 Hands-on mini-projects and code snippets

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Learning Python and problem-solving through CS50
- Studying essential math (linear algebra, probability, calculus) for AI/ML
- Exploring real-world applications and use cases for AI/ML
- Brainstorming ideas for future AI projects

---

## 🧠 Ideas I Want to Explore

- AI for mental health
- ML-powered education tools
- Voice and text-based personal AI assistants
- Rain, emotion, or nature-inspired AI art
- Krishna consciousness + AI creative blends

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (in progress)

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git & GitHub
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib (soon)
- scikit-learn, TensorFlow (coming later)
